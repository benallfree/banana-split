# Banana Split üçå

Banana Split is an open-source tool designed to help couples navigate the process of dividing community property during an uncontested divorce. Our goal is to make this challenging process more manageable, transparent, and fair for both parties.

## Purpose

Divorce is difficult enough without the added stress of dividing assets. Banana Split helps by:

- Providing a clear, organized way to list and value community property
- Allowing flexible asset allocation (100% to one party, split percentages, etc.)
- Generating professional PDF documentation of the agreed division
- Keeping all data local to your browser for privacy
- Supporting import/export of your asset division plan

## Security & Privacy

Your privacy is our top priority:

- All data is stored locally in your browser - nothing is sent to our servers
- No account or personal information required
- No tracking or analytics
- No data collection or sharing with third parties
- Generated PDFs are created entirely in your browser

## Important Disclaimer

Banana Split is not a substitute for legal advice. We strongly recommend:

- Consulting with qualified legal professionals
- Understanding your state's specific community property laws
- Having your agreement reviewed by legal counsel before finalizing

## Usage

1. Enter both parties' names
2. Add your community property assets with values
3. Allocate assets between parties
4. Export your plan as a PDF or JSON file
5. Share with your legal counsel for review
